# Air-Purifier-Development-using-AQI-Analytics

## Project Overview

AirPure Innovations is addressing the air quality crisis in India, where 14 cities are among the worldâ€™s top 20 most polluted. The company is in the early stages of product development, working on an air purifier
solution. Before committing to R&D and production, the team is focused on validating sustained customer demand.

## Problem Statement

The company faces several critical questions that must be answered to ensure market readiness and product relevance:

+ What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
+ What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
+ Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions?
+ How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?
