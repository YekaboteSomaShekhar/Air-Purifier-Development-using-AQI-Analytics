# Air-Purifier-Development-using-AQI-Analytics

## Project Overview

**AirPure Innovations** is addressing the air quality crisis in India, where 14 cities are among the worldâ€™s top 20 most polluted. The company is in the early stages of product development, working on an air purifier
solution. Before committing to R&D and production, the team is focused on validating sustained customer demand.

## Problem Statement

The company faces several critical questions that must be answered to ensure market readiness and product relevance:

+ What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
+ What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
+ Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions?
+ How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to assess the **market feasibility** and **consumer demand** for air purifiers in India before committing to large-scale production and R&D. This will be achieved by analyzing three key dimensions:

+ **Severity Mapping**: Identify cities with high or worsening AQI levels.  
+ **Health Impact**: Measure pollution-related health burden and its effect on consumers.  
+ **Demand Triggers**: Analyze how pollution spikes drive air purifier demand.

**Insights Delivered**:

+ **Max AQI Value**: 500, indicating severe pollution in some areas.
+ States like Delhi, Haryana, and Bihar show higher AQI values.
+ PM2.5 & PM10 are the most critical pollutants, especially in northern states, due to vehicular emissions, construction, and crop residue burning.
+ Chennai and Bengaluru show better air quality (74.43 and 75.51).
+ Top 5 States with Higher Adoption: Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bihar.
+ Water-borne and pollution-related illnesses dominate across states.
+ Less dense states like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Andaman & Nicobar report cleaner air.
+ Policies targeting clean energy, EV incentives and pollution control are in place.
